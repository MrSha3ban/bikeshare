Bike share project
First i started this project wondering how i will control the input from users to reduce time , effort and bugs in my project
so i decided to make it like choices with numbers for each choice.(becaouse numbers has no uper or lower cases)
then i faced another problem : the time of reading the csv file each time you restart the program.
so i decided to make it as one file..take some seconds to create and load...but you can access any part of it in like no time.
after that i looked  at my project  parts running in the terminal and said '' it just  ablack command line screen' and after reading a concept in my classroom
 I searched about (ascii art ) to ad my intro banner to the project
then some issues appear every time i add any code or function
i found the community so helpful and about the extra resources :
in pandas part specialy my pivot table in the code i found my answer here:https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/index.html
in make my intro banner i used :http://www.network-science.de/ascii/
